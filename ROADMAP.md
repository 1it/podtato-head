# Roadmap

Following activities are planned for future implementation of the PodTatoHead Demo Application:

**Multi-(Micro-)service implementation**

The application will be split up into multiple components to depict a microservice architecture. Based on this, more sophisticated deployment scenarios can be represented. A possible approach for this is already implemented in the "microservice"-branch of the podtato-head repository.

**Automated testing of the provided samples**

This should ensure that the provided deployment mechanisms work but also provide real-world examples for their automation.

**Infra/App samples**

In the future, the podtato-head should be a demo application for converged infrastructure/application delivery scenarios.

**Telemetry**

Integration of multiple signal generators for metrics, logging, and tracing collection.

**Addition of more projects**

As the podtato-head should be a reference application for the implementation of application delivery mechanisms, we always aim for more projects providing samples for the configuration of their products.

If you wish to discuss these topics, please contact us in #project-podtato-head (CNCF Slack). While this is just a high-level roadmap of our larger goals, we welcome all PRs, even if they are outside of the scope of this roadmap.

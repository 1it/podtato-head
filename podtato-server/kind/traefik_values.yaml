# Configure ports
ports:
  # The name of this one can't be changed as it is used for the readiness and
  # liveness probes, but you can adjust its config to your liking
  traefik:
    port: 9000
    # Use hostPort if set.
    # hostPort: 9000
    #
    # Use hostIP if set. If not set, Kubernetes will default to 0.0.0.0, which
    # means it's listening on all your interfaces and all your IPs. You may want
    # to set this value if you need traefik to listen on specific interface
    # only.
    # hostIP: 192.168.100.10

    # Override the liveness/readiness port. This is useful to integrate traefik
    # with an external Load Balancer that performs healthchecks.
    # healthchecksPort: 9000

    # Defines whether the port is exposed if service.type is LoadBalancer or
    # NodePort.
    #
    # You SHOULD NOT expose the traefik port on production deployments.
    # If you want to access it from outside of your cluster,
    # use `kubectl port-forward` or create a secure ingress
